# Honey Explore

Creates a local web app for you to explore your schema compatible OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions alongside your [Honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) datasets.

![a screenshot showing the web app](screenshot.png "Web app screenshot")

All attributes are built into a namespace tree from any supplied Semantic Convention registry models. Each attribute has its documentation alongside Honeycomb datasets that have used it in the last 60 days. Clicking on a dataset name will take you to a query in the Honeycomb UI grouping by that attribute.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may need to allow pop-ups in your browser for the Honeycomb query pages.

## Installing

[Follow the instructions on the release page.](https://github.com/jerbly/honey-explore/releases) There are installers of pre-built binaries for popular OSes.

## Building

If you really want to build from source and not use a [pre-built binary release](https://github.com/jerbly/honey-explore/releases) then firstly you'll need a
[Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to compile it:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jerbly/honey-explore.git
$ cd honey-explore
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/honey-explore --version
0.2.0
```

## Usage

```text
Honey Explore

Usage: honey-explore [OPTIONS] --model <MODEL>...

Options:
  -m, --model <MODEL>...  Model paths
  -a, --addr <ADDR>       Address [default: 127.0.0.1:3000]
  -h, --help              Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version           Print version
```

You must provide `HONEYCOMB_API_KEY` as an environment variable or in a `.env` file. This api key must have access to read datasets and columns, create and run queries.

You must provide at least one path to the model root directory of OpenTelemetry Semantic Convention compatible yaml files. Provide multiple root directories separated by spaces after `--model`. It is recommended to clone the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions) project and add this alongside your own Semantic Conventions registry. The path should be prefixed with a single character (emoji recommended) followed by a double colon. For example: `honey-explore --model ðŸ”­::/otel/semantic-conventions/model ðŸ¤–::/my-org/model`
